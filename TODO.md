# TODO

## Notes:
- matching in the mcp server is too aggressive especially for substring based pages 'trf' existing as a page blocks agent on creation of 'trf-quantification'
- mcp tools might be too verbose in their descriptions
- mcp fo rthe ingest pipeline should be removed.. in fact all the background process mcp tools should be removed there is no need to run them in an interactive session... just use the cli
- the cli autoingest pipeline leaves a lot to be desired. this might be model depeendant... i have been using a smaller cheaper model (step-3.5-flash) which might be too stupid to do the task properly or perhaps my skills are not set up well
- we need to do better at tagging


## Rendered Document Responses (Future Direction)

**What:** Replace the JSON response envelope with rendered markdown documents. The daemon becomes a rendering layer: structured data stored and processed internally, markdown documents served to the agent. L1–L4 are incremental improvements; this is the architectural destination.

**Why this is the right direction:**
- The entire system is already in one semantic space — wiki pages, skills, talk pages, plan files, agent reasoning are all markdown. JSON responses are the only format break.
- Behavioral triggers carry full semantic weight in rendered text. `[CRITICAL ISSUE]` in a document is not the same representation as `{"sev":{"crit":1}}` in a JSON blob — the former has learned emotional salience; the latter is just a number.
- No format-switching overhead. The agent's context window is a continuous stream of one register.
- Debuggable without tooling. A developer reading MCP session logs sees documents, not escaped JSON strings.
- The manifest already proves the model. It returns plain text and is the best-behaved tool in the set.
- Extends PHILOSOPHY.md Principle 2 to the wire protocol: plain markdown is the substrate.

**Sketch of rendered formats:**

`wiki_read` response:
```
[MODERATE ISSUE] broken-link-attention-mechanism-a1b2c3
  Broken link to [[bahdanau-attention]] — no target page in vault

## Overview

The [[attention mechanism]] allows a model to dynamically weight positions...

[talk: 2 entries, 1 open]
One open suggestion: cross-link to [[positional-encoding]] from Mechanism section (2026-04-07).
```

`wiki_search` response:
```
rfdiffusion (score: 0.94)
  Diffusion-based protein structure generation; de novo, partial diffusion, motif scaffolding
  Match at line 42: "...For binder design, **motif scaffolding** constrains a fixed structural motif..."

bindsweeper (score: 0.31)
  Multi-dimensional parameter sweep tool — no direct match
```

`wiki_status` response:
```
Vault: ~/wiki
Pages: 14 across 3 clusters | Total: 38,020 tokens
Last indexed: 2026-04-09T14:23:11
```

**Error states:** A consistent prefix that the agent can detect reliably without parsing:
```
[ERROR: not-found] Page "bahdanau-attention" does not exist. Did you mean: bahdanau-2015?
[ERROR: patch-conflict] Context mismatch at line 42. Re-read the page and retry.
```

**What needs to change:**
1. Add a rendering pipeline to the daemon response path — `render_response(response: dict, tool: str) -> str` — called in `_ok()` before wrapping in `TextContent`
2. Define rendered formats for all 17 tools
3. Keep JSON internally for all daemon ↔ daemon communication; only the MCP boundary uses rendered output
4. Update tool descriptions to describe the rendered format agents will receive
5. Update `docs/gallery.md` throughout — this changes every agent-view example
6. Deprecate L1 (compact JSON) once this lands — it becomes irrelevant

## Future Ideas

- **Vault → Managed migration tool**: Pre-packaged workflow that lets 4-8 local LLMs loose on an unstructured Obsidian vault over days/weeks to reorganize it into managed structure (raw sources separated, index built, cross-references added, provenance established). Automated "get it ship shape" pipeline.
